# Hugo defaults to using posts, tags and categories out of the box and this will work fine if thatâ€™s what you want. If you wish to customise this, however, you can do so by creating a taxonomies.toml configuration
# This will replace the default tags and categories with topics. Refer to the Hugo Taxonomy docs for more information on naming taxonomies.
